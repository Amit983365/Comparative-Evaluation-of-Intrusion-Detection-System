# Network-Intrusion-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
Network intrusions classification using algorithms such as  Decision Tree,  K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest.

Designed and implemented a comparative evaluation of intrusion detection systems using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, and K-Neighbor Classifier.
Analyzed the performance of the different algorithms on a variety of attacks for Evaluation.
Identified the K-Neighbor Classifier algorithm as the best performing algorithm for intrusion detection, with an accuracy of over 86%.
